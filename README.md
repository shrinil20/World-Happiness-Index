Data Science project for beginners 


Data analytics is a discipline focused on extracting insights from data. It comprises the 
processes, tools and techniques of data analysis and management, including the collection, 
organization, and storage of data. It organizes, interprets, structures and presents the data into 
useful information that provides context for the data.


The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The report 
continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use 
happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields –
economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more –
describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. 
The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of 
happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.


The World Happiness Index measures what matters: sustainable wellbeing for all. It tells us how 
well nations are doing at achieving long, happy, sustainable lives. The ranking of Happiness 
Index is based on six variables which are: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life 
expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and perceptions of corruption.
